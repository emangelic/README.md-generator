# Node.js README Generator

## Description

This is a command-line tool built with Node.js that generates high-quality `README.md` files for your projects.

### Motivation

Building proper documentation for projects is critical, but it can be time-consuming. This project was created to simplify and automate the creation of `README.md` files, ensuring developers can focus more on coding and less on documentation.

### Problem Solved

This tool addresses the issue of inconsistent or incomplete `README` files, helping developers create well-structured and informative documentation with minimal effort.

### What I Learned

In building this tool, I deepened my understanding of Node.js, the `inquirer` package, and the importance of high-quality project documentation.
